The solution involves checking if the observer is still valid before performing any updates within the asynchronous block of the setter.  We can achieve this by using `weak` references to self and ensuring the observer is still active before accessing properties.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    _myString = newString;
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;  // Avoid strong reference cycles and potential crashes
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        // Simulate an asynchronous operation
        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1];
        if (weakSelf) { // Check if the object is still valid
            NSLog(@"MyString updated asynchronously: %@");
        }
    });
}
@end
```
This revised setter ensures that if the object has been deallocated, the asynchronous operation will not attempt to access deallocated memory, preventing the crash.
